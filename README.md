botorss
=======

Cause i don't have time enough to read all the newspappers, i decided to create Botorss, a little happy bot that publish news (or any content) read from a rss into a social network (for starters will be twitter).

I haven't decided yet wich GUI will have if it will.

Any comment, commit, will be well recieved.
